# Getting Started with the Jetson Nano

This is the repository for my blog series *Getting Started with the Jetson Nano*.

It contains a setup script and Jupyter notebooks.

At present, documentation for these resources is on my blog.

1. [Getting Started with the Jetson Nano](https://blog.rareschool.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-jetson-nano.html)
1. Getting Started - Part 1.5 is now out-of-date: ignore it!
1. [Getting Started with the Jetson Nano - Part 2](https://blog.rareschool.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-jetson-nano-part-2.html) covers the initial boot and Ubuntu configuration.
1. Getting Started with the Jetson Nano - Part 3 will cover installing TensorFlow and other prerequisites, and lead you through training and testing a complete example.

I'll also be covering model import and transfer learning.

The Jupyter notebooks are simplified versions of existing examples;
they contain details of the notebooks from which they were derived.
